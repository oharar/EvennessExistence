# Code for Re-analysis of 'Does evenness even exist?'

This is a port of the code for [Alroy (2025a)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.70181). The first push is just [the original code](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15762246) with minor modifications (moved into different folders, and code to download and import the data). The data are [on Dryad](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.brv15dvdc), and should be downloaded into the data/ folder. It does not need to be unzipped.

The original code was written by [John Alroy](https://bio.mq.edu.au/~jalroy/). It has been updated and added to. 
The whole thing should probably be written as a package, as there are currently too many function that are not documented or tested.
